## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code 2020 Story
After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.

The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
